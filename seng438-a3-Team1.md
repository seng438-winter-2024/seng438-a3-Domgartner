# 1 Introduction

This assignment advanced from the previous work on the JFreeChart program, transitioning from black-box to white-box testing methodologies. While the earlier assignment concentrated on black-box testing, emphasizing functional verification without regard to internal workings, this phase focused on understanding and applying white-box testing principles. Through this progression, we enhanced our grasp of how measuring code coverage aids in formulating more precise test cases. Specifically, we incorporated the EclEmma code coverage tool within our Eclipse/JUnit testing framework, gaining insights into white-box testing's utility alongside other methodologies to thoroughly assess a program's readiness for deployment. The laboratory sessions were instrumental in introducing white-box testing's principles and practices, extending our existing test suite with coverage metrics like statement and branch coverage. By crafting new white-box test cases aimed at improving code coverage, we evaluated enhancements over our initial tests and explored data-flow coverage for specific methods.

Adopting white-box testing strategies and utilizing coverage tools enabled us to ensure exhaustive testing across all code pathways, including branches, loops, and exception handling, to find untested code segments for targeted test suite enhancements. This approach not only facilitated early error detection and code design improvements but also bolstered the code's maintainability. Leveraging the JUnit framework, a cornerstone in Java for crafting and executing repeatable tests, we delved into the intricacies of white-box testing, which unlike black-box testing, requires a thorough understanding of the internal structures of an application. This lab's overarching objective was to equip us with the competence to implement comprehensive and effective white-box testing strategies, thereby elevating our software product's quality through meticulous unit-level functionality verification and enhancing our test suite's coverage.
